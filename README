This project intends to provide a servicemix store implementation using Google Guava Cache Library.
The main objective is to explore guava's functionality concerning cache bulk bootstrapping (both synchronous and asynchronous) and expiration mechanisms.
Also it needs to be backed up by a file storage in case of application restarts.
